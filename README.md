# SpringSecurityGuide
Welcome to the Spring Security Examples repository! In Spring Security, we've witnessed significant changes, notably the deprecation of the trusted `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` in favor of a more streamlined and powerful approach to securing your web applications. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for developers seeking to grasp the latest techniques and best practices in securing their Spring-based web applications.
